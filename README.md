Group Action Quicksort is a variant of the traditional Quicksort algorithm
that leverages concepts from modern algebra and graph theory to improve
its performance. Instead of choosing a single pivot element, Group Action
Quicksort generates a group of candidate pivot elements using a group action
defined on the input array. The group action allows the algorithm to identify
pivot candidates likely to result in balanced array partitions. The algorithm
then selects the best pivot element from the candidate group, which results in
a more efficient partitioning process. The experimental evaluation of Group
Action Quicksort demonstrates that it can outperform the traditional Quicksort
algorithm for certain types of input arrays, such as almost sorted arrays, by
reducing the number of partitioning operations and comparisons. However, its
performance can be worse for other input arrays, such as random and reversed
arrays, depending on the distribution of the pivot candidates. Overall, Group
Action Quicksort is a promising direction for improving the performance of the
Quicksort algorithm and opens up new possibilities for exploring the intersection
of algebra and algorithms.
